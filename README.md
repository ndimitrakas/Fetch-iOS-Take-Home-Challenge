# Fetch iOS Take Home Challenge
 
### Summary: 
- The app fetches and displays recipes using Swift Concurrency (async/await), includes a custom disk-based image cache, and handles network errors, empty states, and malformed data. 

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
- I chose to focus more on the caching and error handling.
- I wanted to focus on these areas because I felt the business requirements were already fulfilled with the singular view (and being able to refresh the view).
- I felt the performance and stability of the application were more important.

### Time Spent:
- Spent around 6â€“8 hours
- API integration (1.5h)
- Image caching (2h)
- Testing (3h)

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
- I kept the UI minimal, avoiding detail views to focus on performance and essential functionality.

### Weakest Part of the Project:
- App does not support sorting or filtering
- No way to clear the cache
